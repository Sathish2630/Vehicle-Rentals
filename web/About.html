            <p>
                We love bikes. We love traveling. And, we want you to love them too! What started as a bike rental platform a year ago is now a complete ecosystem of bikes. From two-wheeler rentals to riding gear, from exclusive bike merchandise to road trips and tours, from bike refurbishing and maintenance to fleet management systems - we have them all.
            </p>

                Our team of experts aims to bridge the gap between bike fanatics and their need for a perfect go-to for all their biking needs. Whether you're a student in a new city or someone who just joined work - you can rent a bike for a day, a week, or even a couple of months, leave your bikes at the station for some good ol' maintenance and pick up some exclusive merch too! Whether you're a startup with a small sales team, a food delivery giant, a logistics company, or a renowned restaurant - for everything that depends on two wheels - ‘GoWheels Hai Na’!
